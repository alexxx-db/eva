Vector Stores
=============

In the realm of handling unstructured data, a prevalent method involves embedding the data and storing the resultant vectors. When querying, the
unstructured query undergoes a similar embedding process, allowing retrieval of vectors most akin to the embedded query. This process is streamlined
by a vector store, which handles the storage of embedded data and facilitates seamless vector searches on your behalf.

EvaDB supports the Vector Stores listed below. You can find a comprehensive benchmark of the vector stores in the following `link <https://medium.com/evadb-blog/how-to-pick-a-vector-database-quantitative-analysis-afae5ea9e5b1>`_.
