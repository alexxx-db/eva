.. warning::

   Currently EvaDB only supports single query in one USE statement. The [native_query] should not end with semicolon.

Examples
--------

.. code:: text

   USE postgres_data {
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS food_review
   };
        
   USE postgres_data {
     CREATE TABLE food_review (name VARCHAR(10), review VARCHAR(1000))
   };

   USE postgres_data {
     INSERT INTO food_review (name, review) VALUES ('Customer 1', 'I ordered fried rice but it is too salty.')
   };
