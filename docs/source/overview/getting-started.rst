Now, activate the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    source evadb-venv/bin/activate

2. Once inside the virtual environment, run the command below to mitigate the dependency issues.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

3. Install EvaDB

4. Verify EvaDB installation

.. code-block:: bash

   pip freeze

You should see a list of installed packages including but not limited to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   Package           Version
   ----------------- -------
   aenum             3.1.15
   decorator         5.1.1
   diskcache         5.6.3
   evadb             0.3.7
   greenlet          2.0.2

   numpy             1.25.2
   pandas            2.1.0
   ...

5. Run EvaDB

Copy the following Python code to a file called `run_evadb.py`.

The program runs a SQL query for listing all the built-in functions in EvaDB. It consists of importing and connecting to EvaDB, and then running the query. The query's result is returned as a Dataframe.

2. Once inside the virtual environment, run the command below to mitigate the dependency issues.

.. code-block:: bash

3. Install EvaDB

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install evadb

4. Verify EvaDB installation

.. code-block:: bash

5. Run EvaDB

Copy the following Python program to a file called `run_evadb.py`.

The program runs a SQL query for listing all the built-in functions in EvaDB. It consists of importing and connecting to EvaDB, and then running the query. The query's result is returned as a Dataframe.
=======
    EvaDB supports additional installation options for extending its functionality. Go over the :doc:`Installation Options <getting-started/installation-options>` for all the available options.
